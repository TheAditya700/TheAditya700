# About Me:
I’m an AI/ML engineer focused on building scalable, production-grade machine learning systems. At G2, I build and automate ML workflows across training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring to support reliable production systems aligned with business objectives. My interests span deep learning, NLP, and graph-based AI, backed by a solid foundation in data engineering and backend systems. I enjoy taking ideas from prototype to production, bridging theory and infrastructure to deliver real-world impact.
